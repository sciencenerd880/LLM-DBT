        1. Write a **persuasive startup pitch** that effectively highlights:
           - The productâ€™s unique value proposition

           - The potential for growth and profitability
           - A call to action for investors

           - A valuation justification
           - The amount of funding requested
           - An appropriate equity offer
           - Key investment terms (e.g., use of funds, investor value add)
